### PySpark Machine Learning
#### Objective
Add Machine Learning (ML) to a Spark application.

#### Setup
* Create a cluster, a bucket (same name) and SSH into master node.
* Create environment variable:

```bash
APIKEY=<your-api-key>
BUCKET=<bucket name>
DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID=<project ID>
export DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
export BUCKET
export APIKEY
```

* Study staging script:
    * Edits the three python scripts 01-dataprocML.py, 02-dataprocML.py, 03-dataprocML.py, and replaces the APIKEY, BUCKET, and DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID with the values from the exported environment variables.
    * Copies the updated files to your bucket in Cloud Storage, so that Dataproc can access them.
    * Copies sample data files to your bucket.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Go to the standard location
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/unstructured/
# "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
#   If this is our first time here, backup the program files
#   If this is a subsequent run, restore fresh from backup before proceeding
#
if [ -d "backup" ]; then
  cp backup/*dataproc* .
else
  mkdir backup
  cp *dataproc* backup
fi
# Verify that the environment variables exist
#
OKFLAG=1
if [[ -v $BUCKET ]]; then
  echo "BUCKET environment variable not found"
  OKFLAG=0
fi
if [[ -v $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID ]]; then
  echo "DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID environment variable not found"
  OKFLAG=0
fi
if [[ -v $APIKEY ]]; then
  echo "APIKEY environment variable not found"
  OKFLAG=0
fi
if [ OKFLAG==1 ]; then
  # Edit the script files
  sed -i "s/your-api-key/$APIKEY/" *dataprocML.py
  sed -i "s/your-project-id/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/" *dataprocML.py
  sed -i "s/your-bucket/$BUCKET/" *dataprocML.py
  # Copy python scripts to the bucket
  gsutil cp *dataprocML.py gs://$BUCKET/
  # Copy data to the bucket
  gsutil cp gs:\/\/cloud-training\/gcpdei\/road* gs:\/\/$BUCKET\/sampledata\/
  gsutil cp gs:\/\/cloud-training\/gcpdei\/time* gs:\/\/$BUCKET\/sampledata\/
fi
```

### Submitting Tasks
The three programs are "snapshots" from a development process. Each program builds on and enhances the one before it. Examining and running each program shows you how to progressively develop a Dataproc/Spark + Machine Learning application.

#### Task 1 [01-dataprocML.py](https://github.com/shawlu95/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/unstructured/01-dataprocML.py)
This program is just a Python program. It will run on Dataproc, but it does not make use of any of the big data features. The program creates a sample line of text in memory and then passes it to the Natural Language Processing service for Sentiment Analysis.

The `stagelabs.sh` script you ran in Task 1 should have replaced the DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID, BUCKET, and APIKEY with your information from the environment variables.

**Submit**: in Dataproc -> Jobs, submit job with PySpark type, in same region, and main Python file `gs://<bucket name>/01-dataprocML.py` Equivalent command line:

```bash
gcloud dataproc jobs wait job-994b60b4 --project qwiklabs-gcp-968cc3e724ddeff8 --region us-central1
```

Console output:

#### Task 2: Sentiment Analysis with Spark [02-dataprocML.py](https://github.com/shawlu95/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/unstructured/02-dataprocML.py)
This program reads a text file and passes to a Natural Language Processing service, sentiment analysis, and processes the results in Spark.

Copy a text file to bucket:
```bash
gsutil cp /training/road-not-taken.txt gs://$BUCKET/sampledata/road-not-taken.txt
```
**Submit**: in Dataproc -> Jobs, submit job with PySpark type, in same region, and main Python file `gs://<bucket name>/02-dataprocML.py`. Equivalent command line:
